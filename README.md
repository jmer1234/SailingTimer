# Sailing Timer

### A sailing race start timer for the Garmin Connect IQ platform, following the ISAF 5-4-1-0 sequence

Every minute emits a beep and vibrates.

At the start emits an alarm, vibrates and then times up for the race duration.

The timer can be synchronised to the nearest minute, up or down.

### Modes

- Standard mode: starts at 5 minutes.
- Pursuit mode: allows offset to be configured. Main timer shows 5 minute sequence, offset timer shows your start.

### Compatibility

In theory, supports D2 Bravo/Titanium, Epix, Fênix 3/HR/Chronos, Fênix 5/X/S, Forerunner 230/235/630/735XT/920XT/935 and Vivoactive/HR.

Only tested on real hardware on the Fênix 3 as that's the device I own. Other devices tested on the simulator. Please test on your device and report bugs/give feedback on Github
